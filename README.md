# JD_Final

The main.py file is the file that you run to run the program

The input.txt file is where you can input the city and state respectively (Full state name or 2 letter abbreviation)
Alternatively you can enter the city and state into the terminal if the values in the input.txt are not found within the datasets.

The output.txt shows the output of the program. The terminal will also display this information


All of the completed forms of the functions are found in the functions.py file.
The rest of the files within this folder are either the datasets themselves or .py files that were used for testing purposes. For a product these testing files would be removed, but they are included to show the design process of the project.
